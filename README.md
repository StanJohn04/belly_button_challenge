# Background
Build interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset
-The Dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navals.
-The data reveals that a small handful of microbial species, also called operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people

The dashboard is deployed on Github Pages and can be accessed [here](https://stanjohn04.github.io/belly_button_dashboard/)

# Interactivity
The dashboard is desgined to be interactive. The user can select an ID number that will change the graphs and charts accordingly

Both the demographic info panel and the gauge chart are designed to move with the scroll of the page in order to fill the ugly whitespace.
